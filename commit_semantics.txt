Okay, so the past bunch of commit descriptions have been just completely
and uterlly useless and erratic, so I'm going to attempt to establish a standard
so that it is actually clear what is going on when I push a new commit.

COMMIT SUMMARY:
- should ideally a brief, all capitals general class of "thing" that ideally
  I usually am doing or have done when I decide to push a commit
- will be ONE or a CONCATENATION (with /) of:
    - WORKING ON
      (when I'm working on a NEW feature and want to make a quick backup)
    - COMPLETED
      (when I've been working on something for a while and it's now done)
    - TESTING
      (when I've been playing around with testing my program and am making a backup)
    - DEBUGGING
      (when I've completed a feature and now I'm searching/fixing bugs within it)
    - FIXED BUG
      (when I'm DEBUGGING and I've found and eliminated a bug)
    - ADDED
      (when I've added a feature)
    - REMOVED
      (when I've removed a feature)
    - CHANGED
      (when I've changed a feature)
    - <feature-name> is fucked
      (when I get really really frustrated)

COMMIT DESCRIPTION
- should contain "> points" of each major thing pretaining to the COMMIT SUMMARY
- after each "> point" a short written remark about how it's going/what I've decided
  to do/what I have planned for later

COMMIT EXAMPLES:
    summary     : WORKING ON
    description : > reworking renderBuffer internal packing
                    changing the internal packing scheme to be more spacially compact
                  > reworking how shaders working
                    changing shader interface to have more features

    summary     : FIXED BUG
    description : > finally eliminated that ridiculous matrix bug

    summary     : ADDED
    description : > ability to shuffle components in QVector3
                    this is important for <feature-name> that I'm working on

    summary     : ADDED/CHANGED
    description : > added commit_semantics.txt to finally resolve commit styles
                    it was about time
                  > changed some folder names to be more consistent
